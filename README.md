### Smart Flashlight
### Emergency and fire situations

# Description
* The current location of the rescuer can be determined by using a flashlight in case of fire and emergency in the building.

# Features
1. HM-10 Bluetooth module supports Bluetooth 4.0BLE, is low power efficient, and is easy to install due to miniaturization.

2. A beacon scanner is mounted on a flashlight to deliver information to the outside world where you are currently in the process of escaping the building.

3. Considering that the building's network will be paralyzed, the LTE cat.m1 module can be used to transmit location information to the server using its own network.

4. Firefighters and rescuers can find out where survivors are by viewing this information on the web or on an app, allowing them to conduct rescue operations more quickly.

# Main Modules Used
* RasberryPi 4 Model B
* Arduino UNO
* Codezoo LTE CAT.M1
